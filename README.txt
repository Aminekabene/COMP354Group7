The plan is to have a java android app have a WebView frame, displaying a Web application that is displaying the Map. Furthermore, we have a part of the android app in java that takes the provided GPX file*.  converts it into the array of pairs*, and then passes this array to the Web application to draw a polyline. 

TO-DO: The web application and the GPX converter are basically done. 
We need to find a way to display the web application inside the Java android app.



*GPX file - essentially a XML file with a set of coordinates
*Here a pair will be a Coord object that just contains 2 double values signifying longitude and latitude
